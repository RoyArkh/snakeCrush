# snakeCrush
this is a small snake game I made as a side project using python turtle library for you to ask your crush out, use it as you please!

### Snake game
The whole game is the remake of the classical snake, it tracks your score and highscore (until the window is closed).

### Main outcome
The game has a parameter called required_score which you can set manually, that is the minimum score which if reached by the person playing will result in the "will you be my gf/bf?" window. The answer given in that window will be written into the "thatsWhatSheSaid" txt file.

In case that score is not reached the game is automatically reset to the beginning state.
